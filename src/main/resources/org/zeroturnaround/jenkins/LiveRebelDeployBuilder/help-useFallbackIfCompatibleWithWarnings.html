LiveRebel runs an offline diff between the new version of the archive and the old version. If it encounters any changes that might cause runtime problems (updated configuration files that your application does not re-read, uninitialized variables) then it emits a warning. Most of the time it is safe to run these updates in favour of speed. To make sure that you don't get any runtime problems you can enforce a different strategy that will limit this risk.
